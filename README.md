**Shinshi** is a website that hosts detailed information about different anime to its community. 
**Shinshi** borrows its name from the Japanese word for ‚Äòdivine messenger‚Äô or Á•û‰Ωø. In Japanese mythology, a shinshi can be any animal and they are used "to transmit divine will or to bear oracles" from Japanese Gods. **Shinshi's** pigeon mascot is meant to bring information and reviews about anime to its users.

At **Shinshi** all guests can see a **Home View** which displays the 10 most recent anime sorted by date of airing. Moving on to the **Catalog View**, guests see all anime listed on the website in alphabetical order. When an Anime is clicked, it will lead to the **Detail View** where guests will see detailed information about the anime as well as users reviews.


All users are able to create, edit, and delete reviews on the **Detail View**. Users can also navigate to their own **Watched view** and **Reviews view** when signed in. Users can use these views to track which anime they have watched and what reviews they have left.

Admins have the ability to add a new Anime to **Shinshi**. From the **Detail View**, admins can edit and delete an anime.

**Shinshi** also looks great on Mobile!
