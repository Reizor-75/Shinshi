**Shinshi** is a website that hosts detailed information about different anime to its community. 
**Shinshi** borrows its name from the Japanese word for ‚Äòdivine messenger‚Äô or Á•û‰Ωø. In Japanese mythology, a shinshi can be any animal and they are used "to transmit divine will or to bear oracles" from Japanese Gods. **Shinshi's** pigeon mascot is meant to bring information and reviews about anime to its users.
